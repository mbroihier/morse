# Morse

This project implements a Morse code transmitter.  It uses ideas from rpitx (https://github.com/F5OEO/rpitx) and from my servo daemon project (https://github.com/mbroihier/servod).

This version has only been tested on RPI 3's.  It should work on a PI 0 without modification.  It will not work on a PI 4 without modification.

## To compile
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mbroihier/morse
$ cd morse
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

## To Use
In the build directory:
```
$ sudo ./morse 28100000 10 "CQ CQ CQ de KG5YJE KG5YJE K"
```
This sends the message "CQ CQ CQ de KG5YJE KG5YJE K" at 10 words per minute on frequency 28.1 MHz
